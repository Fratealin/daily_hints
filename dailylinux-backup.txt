tree -a ./foldername

Most commonly used bash command:
history | awk '{CMD[$2]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] " " CMD[a]/count*100 "% " a;}' | grep -v "./" | column -c3 -s " " -t | sort -nr | nl |  head -n10
Awk is the most important part in line above, It simply stores the command and counts the occurrence in history ( column 2, $2), at the end of operation, it prints the result. 
Passes to grep -v to filter out “./”, because ./something is not a linux command. After that, arrange the data in columns and sort it numerically. List only the top ten with numbers using head and nl.

Ctrl+L – clears the screen (same effect as the “clear” command).

Ctrl+S – pause all command output to the screen. If you have executed a command that produces verbose, long output, use this to pause the output scrolling down the screen.

Ctrl+Q – resume output to the screen after pausing it with Ctrl+S.

Ctrl+A or Home – moves the cursor to the start of a line.

Ctrl+E or End – moves the cursor to the end of the line.

Ctrl+B or Left Arrow – moves the cursor back one character at a time.

Ctrl+F or Right Arrow – moves the cursor forward one character at a time.

Ctrl + Left Arrow or Alt+B or Esc and then B – moves the cursor back one word at a time.

Ctrl + Right Arrow or Alt+C or Esc and then F – moves the cursor forward one word at a time.

Ctrl+R – starts a reverse search, through the bash history, simply type characters that should be unique to the command you want to find in the history.

Ctrl+S – launches a forward search, through the bash history.

Ctrl+G – quits reverse or forward search, through the bash history.

Ctrl+D or Delete – remove or deletes the character under the cursor.

Ctrl+K – removes all text from the cursor to the end of the line.

Ctrl+X and then Backspace – removes all the text from the cursor to the beginning of the line.

Ctrl+T – transposes the character before the cursor with the character under the cursor.

Esc and then T – transposes the two words immediately before (or under) the cursor.

Esc and then U – transforms the text from the cursor to the end of the word to uppercase.

Esc and then L – transforms the text from the cursor to the end of the word to lowercase.

Esc and then C – changes the letter under the cursor (or the first letter of the next word) to uppercase, leaving the rest of the word unchanged.

Ctrl+Z – suspend the current foreground process. This sends the SIGTSTP signal to the process. You can get the process back to the foreground later using the fg process_name (or %bgprocess_number like %1, %2 and so on) command.

Ctrl+C – interrupt the current foreground process, by sending the SIGINT signal to it. The default behavior is to terminate a process gracefully, but the process can either honor or ignore it.

Ctrl+D – exit the bash shell (same as running the exit command).

!! – execute last command.

!top – execute the most recent command that starts with ‘top’ (e.g. !).

!top:p – displays the command that !top would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history).

!$ – execute the last word of the previous command (same as Alt +., e.g. if last command is ‘cat tecmint.txt’, then !$ would try to run ‘tecmint.txt’).

!$:p – displays the word that !$ would execute.

!* – displays the last word of the previous command.

!*:p – displays the last word that !* would substitute.

find ./foldername -name filename.txt 

find ./foldername -name *.txt

search for text within multiple files

find ./ -type f -name "*.txt" -exec grep 'Geek'  {} \;
